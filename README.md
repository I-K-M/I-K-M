Hi, I'm Ismael ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» I am a developer building custom WordPress & Shopify websites and deploying SEO strategies ðŸ’»

I'm passionate about development, especially when it comes to crafting beautiful and functional user interfaces. My expertise lies in HTML and CSS, where I spend a lot of time building responsive and visually appealing websites. I also use JavaScript, PHP & Liquid to bring more interactivity and functionality to my projects. I'm always exploring new technologies and frameworks. My love for UI/UX design drives my approach to front-end development, ensuring that I focus on both aesthetics and user experience.

While my main focus is on the front-end, I'm gradually exploring the back-end world to become a more well-rounded developer. My goals (when I find the time): learn Python, C, Go, and other pure backend languages.
ðŸ“ˆ I'm currently working for the Talk Digital agency & AKSES France ðŸ“ˆ
