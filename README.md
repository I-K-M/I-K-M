Hi, I'm Ismael ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» I am a developer building websites and deploying SEO strategies ðŸ’»

I'm passionate about development, especially when it comes to crafting beautiful and functional user interfaces. My expertise lies in HTML/CSS/JS/React, where I spend a lot of time building responsive and visually appealing websites. I also use PHP, Node & Liquid to bring more interactivity and functionality to my projects. I'm always exploring new technologies and frameworks.

While my main focus is on the front-end, I'm gradually exploring the back-end world to become a more well-rounded developer. My goal (when I find the time): learn Golang.
I'm currently working for the Talk Digital agency ðŸ“ˆ
